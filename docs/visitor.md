# Visitor Pattern
Clearly articulate the problem addressed by the design instance.

To allow for configuration, the News Aggregator program accepts a configuration
file that must follow a specific format. The config file is parsed by an ANTLR
module that produces a parse tree containing the data found in the config file.
The problem that this instance of the visitor pattern seeks to address is how to
collect the relevant data from the parse tree for use by the News Aggregator
program.

## Pattern Used & SOLID Principle Addressed
Clearly articulate the Design Pattern used or SOLID principle addressed (or both).

## Implementation of Design
Present (in some form) the code relevant to the design instance.

## Benefits of This Design in Context
Clearly articulate the benefits of the Design Pattern or SOLID principle for this design instance in the context of your code.

## Comparison Against Alternative Designs
Discuss alternative design options and compare the advantages/disadvantages with your design. This may include a comparison to a traditional technique, to a naive approach, to an approach you initially used, or to an approach that, on reflection, you wish you had used.
