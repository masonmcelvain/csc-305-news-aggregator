# Final Analysis

A review of the News Aggregator I made for CSC 305 in Spring 2021. Specifically, this is an analysis of three instances where I used design patterns inpsired by *Design Patterns by Gamma et al.* to satisfy the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles.

## Design Patterns Analyzed
* [Visitor Pattern](visitor.md)
* [Composite Pattern](composite.md)
* [Decorator Pattern](decorator.md)
